 For our Personal Web Page assignment in the GMT458 WebGIS course, I created a web page containing my own information. I used artificial intelligence and YouTube platforms at some points during my assignment. First, while using OpenLayers, I used code help from GEMINI for zoom and automatic moving maps. In the final part of my assignment, I used the video https://youtu.be/BT4WzyT2g8k?si=DS2SXi88qkY7n0Ty to obtain my page URL.
